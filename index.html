        <h2>The Project</h2>

        <p>
            Just Jammin' is inspired by a lot of open source project out there which help us in doing the work we like to 
            do, follow our passion that too without taking any amount of money from us. The aim is to make this project
            so big that most of the people interested in music should become happy and satisfied after using Just Jammin'.
            The project is very new and not yet upto the mark, we would aprreciate inputs from you all both as a user
            as well as a developer or music expert or design expert. There have been many DAWs out there many are free but
            a lot are paid too and the thing I observed was that the free ones are not that good as the paid are.  For eg.
            FL studios is one of the best DAW out in the market but it is paid it is not that costly but still the common people
            who do jobs or are students are not that much dedicated to buy a software and work on it, so we need these type of open 
            sources and free software. There has been a misconception that free or open sources dont provide that much as their paid alternatives
            provide and this misconsumption has been successfully bashed by the great open sources like blender and we like to grow like them.
            Hope you like this project and help us grow it. Treat Peaople With Kindness âœŒðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜Š....
